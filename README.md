# Alarms
A alarm system that adds how many alarms do you want with a name.

Modules that I use:

- [x] threading
- [x] datetime
- [x] winsound
- [x] time
- [x] queue
- [x] gtts
- [x] playsound
- [x] os

Just 'gtts' and 'playsound' needs to be installed with pip, the other modules doesn't need previous installation.
